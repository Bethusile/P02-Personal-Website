                <dd>I specialize in sewing satin material to make hair bonnets, scrunchies, pillowcases, duvet covers 
                    and sheets. I find it difficult to balance school and business.

            <dt>I play the violin</dt>
                <dd>
                    Musical geniuses like Kanye West inspire me to explore my full musical potential. 
                    I would love to play the piano some day and have an audience to entertain.
