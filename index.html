        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>I am a mother to a 3 year old boy, a daughter, a sister and a friend to many. 
            I am also a BCom Accounting graduate, persuing my second degree in BSC Computer science.
            I am a fearless, confident people person and I LOVE to look beautiful and smell good.  
            I am very strong willed and I expect a lot from myself... sometimes to my detriment.
